## Question 1: Given some sample data, write a program to answer the following: click here to access the required data set

On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis.

a. Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data.
b. What metric would you report for this dataset?
c. What is its value?

## Answers:

a.Inside this dataset, we have store 78 and store 42 exhibit abnormalies.

- Store 42, there is 1 user that keep order up to 2000 sneakers which is very weird, so most likely this is a bad data to include in our dataset.
- Store 78, the order_value for only a small amount of sneakers can not be as high as \$100000. Therefore, we should exclude this data.

b. For this dataset, it would be much wiser to report the most common order value (mode) and the 50th percentile order value (median). I believe we should these 2 metrics because they tell us what is the order value that often happens and what is the spread of each order value. Also, these 2 metrics help us preventing abnormal data like that of store 42 and store 78.

This helps us get a better understand what is the current performance across 100 stores without much inteference from outliners.

c.
Median: 284
Mode: 153
